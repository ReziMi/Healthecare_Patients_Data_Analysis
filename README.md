# Healthcare Data Analysis

This repository showcases a **comprehensive healthcare data analysis project** using **PostgreSQL** and **Power BI**, demonstrating the ability to transform raw hospital data into actionable insights.

## Project Overview

The dataset includes patient visits with:

- Demographics: age, gender, race  
- Satisfaction scores  
- Wait times  
- Department referrals  
- Administrative flags  

The analysis addresses **patient experience, operational efficiency, and equity of care**.

## SQL Analysis Highlights

Eight SQL queries provide insights for hospital executives:

1. **Patient Satisfaction Analysis** – Identifies top- and low-performing departments (Gastroenterology highest, Renal lowest).  
2. **Wait Time Efficiency** – Correlation between wait time and satisfaction is very weak (-0.021); bucket analysis reveals nuanced patterns.  
3. **High-Risk Age Groups** – Adults have the most visits and highest satisfaction; seniors have lowest satisfaction.  
4. **Racial Equity in Care** – Satisfaction varies by race, with Pacific Islanders highest and Two or More Races lowest.  
5. **Referral Patterns** – Departments with fewer referrals sometimes have longer wait times, highlighting capacity constraints.  
6. **Administrative Impact** – Patients with admin flags experience slightly shorter wait times and higher satisfaction.  
7. **Top Departments by Satisfaction** – Department ranking reinforces satisfaction insights and opportunities for improvement.  
8. **Trend Over Time** – Monthly trends show moderate fluctuation in satisfaction and stable wait times, supporting seasonal planning.

## Power BI Dashboard

The accompanying **interactive dashboard** visualizes:

- Department satisfaction and wait times  
- Age group and racial analysis  
- Referral volumes and operational efficiency  
- Monthly trends in satisfaction and wait time  

## Skills Demonstrated

- PostgreSQL: aggregation, ranking, window functions, CTEs, correlation  
- Data visualization and reporting using Power BI  
- Executive-level insights for hospital operations  

This project illustrates how **data-driven decision-making** can improve patient care and operational efficiency.
